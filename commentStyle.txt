This is THE guide for how I want to style my JSDoc commenting, to keep it all as consistent as possible.
TOC:
0. Some notes
1. Classes
2. Functions

******
NOTES:
1. For @param {paramType}, use number, string, or your own custom type. 
2. Most of the tags don't really do much for my purposes, but consistency aids understanding.

********
CLASSES:

--- External documentation
1. Summary: begin with the short description of the class, no tag necessary.
2. @see: @see any other bit we should refer to to understand functionality
3. @constructor: denotes the start of describing the constructor
4. @param: denotes the parameters for the class's constructor, along with a brief explanation of what they do
5. @property: various properties of the class that are important to know about. List in order
6. @method: functions of the class, include any necessary parameters as @method functionName(functionParam)

--- Internal documentation
(Do note, much of this is just copying the documentation from outside to it's relevant areas.)
1. constructor notes: For the constructor, mark down the parameters and other notes as you had outside the class.
2. @method: Also document the methods internally, documenting parameters in more detail here if needed.

*********
FUNCTIONS:

--- External documentation
1. @function: Name of the function and description
2. @see: Anything else we should reference to understand the function
3. @param: explain the parameters of the function
4. More explanation, as needed
