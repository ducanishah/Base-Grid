This is a rudimental autochess-like simulator created to explore grid-based interaction between actors on a turn based system, and to expand my knowledge of js. Having created the rudimental pathfinding, actor-and-move system, and combat, I am deeming this project completed. I will likely fork this in the future to use as the basis for future grid-based enterprises.
